### John Papa Style Guide

For this starter kit I followed John Papa's Angular 1.* style guide, and adapted the application structure to run with Grunt. See his comprehensive guide [here](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md).

### BEM SASS

I love using SASS/SCSS in all my projects, and BEM is my naming convention of choice. Obviously you may choose to use which ever setup or configuration nescessary for your projects but if you wish to read more about incorporating BEM naming conventions with SASS follow this [link](http://www.alwaystwisted.com/post.php?s=2014-02-27-even-easier-bem-ing-with-sass-33).
